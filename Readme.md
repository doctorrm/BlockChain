On the bitcoin network nodes share their blockchains and the longest valid chain is accepted by the network. What’s to stop someone tampering with data in an old block then creating a whole new longer blockchain and presenting that to the network ?** Proof of work**. 

The hashcash proof of work system means it takes considerable time and computational power to create new blocks. Hence the attacker would need more computational power than the rest of the peers combined.
